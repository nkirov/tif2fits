 Based on photographic data of the Leibniz Astrophysical Observatory
 Potsdam - Kapteyn Selected Areas Survey obtained using the 80 cm Great
 Refractor and 15 cm Zeiss Triplet telescope at Telegrafenberg - Potsdam 
 in the period 1910-1933. The plates were digitized using professional 
 flatbed scanners EPSON 10000XL/V700 and processed in the present digital
 form. The project of Plate digitization was funded by a German DFG grant
 STE: 710/6-1,20.11.2009 and partially of the grants of Bulgarian 
 Ministry of Education and Science DO-02-273/275,18.12.2009.
