Convert TIF file to FITS and more
The main functions of tif2fits software are:
• conversion of the row-tiff files, produced by VueScan to FITS format files,
•	updating some fields in the FITS header and adding the header to the image to complete the FITS file,
•	separation of the wedge part of the image producing two FITS files – one for the plate and one for the wedge,
•	rotation and/or flip the plate image,
•	splitting up two images in case of scanning two small plates together.
