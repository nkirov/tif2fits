 Based on photographic data of the Konkoly Observatory of 
 the Hungerian Academy of Sciences obtained using the 60/90/180 cm

 flatbed scanners EPSON V750 PRO and processed in the present 
 digital form. The project of plate digitization was funded in 
 the frames of the bilateral cooperation between Bulgarian Academy 
 of Sciences and Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and partially by 
 the grants of the Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science 
 DO-02-273/275,18.12.2009.
