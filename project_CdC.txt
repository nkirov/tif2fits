 Based on photographic data of the Astrophysical Observatory
 Potsdam obtained using the 32.5 cm photographic refractor at
 Telegrafenberg in the period 1893-1924 within the framework
 of the Carte du Ciel project. The plates were digitized using
 professional flatbed scanners EPSON 10000XL/V700 and processed
 in the present digital form. The project of plate digitization
 was funded by a German DFG grant 436 BUL 113/110/0-3 and
 partially of the grants of Bulgarian Ministry of Education and
 Science DO-02-273/275.
 The investigators using these scans are kindly requested to
 include the above acknowledgements in any publications.
